WELCOME TO MYFOODS 

To access the dependencies select the "app" - >"build.gradle"  files (make sure its the application gradle file) 

To access the java files go to "app" -> "src" -> "main" -> "java".... 
	All the java files can be seen by following this path 

To access the xml (design) files go to "app" -> "src" -> "main" -> "res" -> "layout" 
	All other design objects like icons can be found in the "res" folder 

To access the manifest file go to "app" -> "src" -> "main" -> "AndroidManifest" file 


To download the application, first download Android Studio 
Then import the project to Android Studio... 
	Make sure dependencies are downloaded correctly, they tend to break when importing to Android Studio so you might have to re-write them 
	You will also need an emulator or you can use your own phone to present the app 
	Android Studio allows you to create an emulator, make sure to use API 24, otherwise it might not work properly.  
	You will have to sign up to the Spoonacular API and input the authentication key into the code (I stated everywhere to put it). 
	Here is a link that can help with downloading the app in Android Studio

If there are any issues with downloading my project, let me know I will be happy to help.
